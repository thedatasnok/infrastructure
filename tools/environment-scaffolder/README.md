# Environment scaffolder

This tool is used to help me create new environments for my projects.

The goal is to be able to create a new environment using a single command, which will create a namespace and other necessary resources in Kubernetes and a new environment in the project's repository with configuration that can be used in deployment pipelines.

## Usage example

```bash
environment-scaffolder ...
```
